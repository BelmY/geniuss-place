The _maker movement_ is a trend in which people employ do-it-yourself (DIY) and do-it-with-others (DIWO) techniques and processes to develop unique technology products. This culture emphasizes learning-through-doing in a social environment, and thus it has spurred the creation of "maker spaces" and [Fab Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fab_lab){:target="_blank"} (open, small-scale workshops with computer-controlled tools and flexible manufacturing equipment such as 3D printers, CNC machines, printed circuit board milling and etching tools, cutters, etc.) around the World. Those are spaces where people share ideas, tools and skillsets, creating an environment that encourages novel applications of technologies and the exploration of intersections between traditionally separate domains, and developing a _just-try-it_ mentality through rapid prototyping and iteration.

  A free and open source software-defined GNSS receiver constitutes an excellent opportunity to exercise product design processes and methodologies.
