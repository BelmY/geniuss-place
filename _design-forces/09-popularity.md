_Popularity_ is a complex social phenomenon with no agreed upon definition. It can be defined in terms of liking, attraction, dominance, superiority, or just being _trendy_. Through peer influence, target objects can quickly skyrocket in how pervasive they are in the user community and because popularity is judged in a social context, the more pervasive it is, the more popular it might be considered.


## Indicators of Popularity

Possible popularity indicators are:

* Number of users / customers / licenses sold.
* Traffic to the site, measured with a counter installed on site and traffic analysis systems, such as Google Analytics.
*  Size of users community.
*  Number of references / citations in scientific papers and technical reports.
