_Maintainability_ refers to the ease with which a product can be maintained in order to isolate and correct defects or their cause, repair or replace faulty or worn-out components without having to replace still working parts, prevent unexpected breakdowns, maximize a product's useful life, maximize efficiency, reliability, and safety, meet new requirements, make future maintenance easier, or cope with a changed environment.


## Indicators of Maintainability

It follows a list of possible maintainability indicators for a software-defined GNSS receiver:

* Time to Fix Defects.
* Source code under a version control system.
* Well--established programming language.
* Automated build environments.
* Availability of an issue tracking system.
* Availability of "debugging modes" and tools.
* Availability of static and dynamic code analysis tools.
* Definition of a source tree structure.
* Automated documentation system.
* Availability and observance of a coding style guide.
* Availability of required and optional software dependencies (type of license, pricing, maintenance / development status).
