_Reproducibility_ refers to the ability of an entire experiment or study to be reproduced, either by the researcher or by someone else working independently. It is one of the main principles of the scientific method and relies on _ceteris paribus_ (other things being equal). When applied to software engineering, it has other additional implications such as in security (_i.e._, gaining confidence that a distributed binary code is indeed coming from a given verified source code).
