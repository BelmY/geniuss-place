When referred to software, _testability_ is the degree to which a software artefact (_i.e._, a software system, software module, requirements, or design document) supports testing in a given test context. Testability is not an intrinsic property of a software artefact and cannot be measured directly (such as software size). Instead, testability is an extrinsic property that results from interdependency of the software to be tested and the test goals, test methods used, and test resources (_i.e._, the test context).

Testability can be understood as visibility and control:

 * **Visibility** is our ability to observe the states, outputs, resource usage and other side effects of the software under test.
 * **Control** is our ability to apply inputs to the software under test or place it in specified states.
