_Marketability_ is a measure of the ability of a security to be bought and sold. If there is an active marketplace for a security, it has good marketability. Producing higher quality products and pricing them competitively can increase marketability, attracting consumers wanting to choose our product over an equally priced item with less quality. But marketability can be also increased by radically changing the features of existing products by means of a technology shift, attracting customers with new product/service benefits (lower prices, openness, usefulness, sense of community, closer interaction between users and the actors of the value chain) while approaching quality of well-established products on the market, as well as opening blue oceans of market space.
