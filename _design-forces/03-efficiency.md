In this context, _efficiency_ refers to optimizing the speed and memory requirements of the software receiver. Specifically, we are interested on how fast the software receiver can process the incoming signal, and in particular if signal processing up to the position fix can be done in real-time using a RF front-end (and how many channels it can sustain in parallel). Efficiency can also refer to the optimization of power consumption required by the processor running the software receiver.
