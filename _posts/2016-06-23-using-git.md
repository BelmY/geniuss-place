Brief overview of Git usage.

<!--more-->

One of the greatest advantages of open source is the ability to view,
modify and share the source code. This means diagnosing and fixing
problems, or adding new features or documentation. In order to
contribute these fixes/improvements to the project’s developers, you
need to send them back your changes in an adequate manner. This can be
done by creating and sending a patch file, or by doing a pull request.
Scroll down for more details about how to do that.

For the version control system we use [Git](http://git-scm.com/), a free and open source
application that automates the process of keeping an annotated history
of the project, allowing reversion of code changes, easy branching and
merging, sharing and change tracking. The [GNSS-SDR’s GitHub
repository](https://github.com/gnss-sdr/gnss-sdr) hosts all of the data files needed for version control,
being the central “truth” repository resource of GNSS-SDR’s source code.
A repository is simply a place where the history of the work is stored.
The distributed nature of Git allows users to clone this repository,
that is, to obtain an exact replica of the original repository at their
own local hard drive. Then, users can build and use the software, modify
the source code, share their work, and contribute back to GNSS-SDR. Git
is a fantastic but complex source code management system - it has a
steep learning curve, but it worth it. A good reference is the freely
available [Git Pro book](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2), but there are plenty of good Git tutorials
out there. If you have never used it, start from the [Git Basics](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics).

Branching in Git is one of its many great features. A branch represents
an independent line of development or, more accurately, a directed
acyclic graph of development. If you have used other version control
systems, it is probably helpful to forget most of what you think about
branches - in fact, it may be more helpful to think of them practically
as contexts since that is how you will most often be using them. When
you checkout different branches, you change contexts that you are
working in, and you can quickly context-switch back and forth between
several different branches. Every time you switch to a new branch, you
will actually see different files in your local folder.

In GNSS-SDR, the source code comes in two flavours: “`master`” and
“`next`” (these are in fact the names of the Git branches). While
“`master`” is the main, most stable branch that contains the latest
release, “`next`” is where all the development is happening, the most
bleeding edge code out there. Once you have cloned the main repository,
you can easily switch between these two branches (or any other created
by you or fetched from other users) by going to your git-cloned
repository and issuing the `git checkout` command with the name of the
desired branch name, like this:

    $ git checkout master   # now you are in the master branch
    $ git checkout next     # now you are in the next branch

If you do not know in which branch you are, pay attention to the first
line of this command’s output:

    $ git status


## How to work with the source code and submit your changes

If you still not have one, please [sign up in GitHub](https://github.com/join) and
create your personal account (it's free).

The first thing you need to do in order to submit your changes to the GNSS-SDR
repository is to fork from it. This can be done either by following [this link](https://github.com/gnss-sdr/gnss-sdr/fork), by clicking in the following button:

[Fork GNSS-SDR from GitHub](https://github.com/gnss-sdr/gnss-sdr/fork){: .btn .btn--success .btn--x-large}
{: style="text-align: center;"}

or by browsing to [https://github.com/gnss-sdr/gnss-sdr](https://github.com/gnss-sdr/gnss-sdr) and clicking in the Fork button at the upper-right corner of the screen.

Once you have forked the repository, open a terminal and (if you have not done so yet) configure Git with some basic information, such as your identity:

```
$ git config user.name "Your Name"
$ git config user.email your@email.abc
```

Then, go to your favourite working folder and type:

    $ git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/gnss-sdr

This gets the latest upstream source and clones it into a
directory called `gnss-sdr`.

If you already cloned the repository before, just go to the root folder `gnss-sdr` and download the latest changes, keeping your repository in sync with the order of committed changes in
the origin (this is required before submitting your changes back to
origin):

    $ git pull --rebase

Now that you are up to date, go to the `next` branch and create a new
branch off from it:

    $ git checkout next
    $ git checkout -b my_feature

Whenever you want to work on something, create a branch for it. Then, do
your changes, stage modified and new files and do commits:

    ... (change files, compile, test) ...
    $ git add file1.cc file1.h ...    # This is called file staging
    $ git commit -m "adding stuff"    # Records staged files to the repository

As you edit files, Git sees them as modified, because you have changed
them since your last commit. You stage these modified files and then
commit all your staged changes, and the cycle repeats. The command git
add puts the files into a “staging area”, an index where you get to
determine what changes get shipped away in the next commit, that is,
what files are going to be recorded to the repository. If you need more
details about this process, check this Git tutorial on how to record
changes in your repository. Next figure summarizes this workflow:
