One of the greatest advantages of open source is the ability to view,
modify and share the source code. This means diagnosing and fixing
problems, or adding new features or documentation. In order to
contribute these fixes/improvements to the project’s developers, you
need to send them back your changes in an adequate manner. This can be
done by creating and sending a patch file, or by doing a pull request.
Scroll down for more details about how to do that.

For the version control system we use [Git](http://git-scm.com/){:target="_blank"}, a free and open source
application that automates the process of keeping an annotated history
of the project, allowing reversion of code changes, easy branching and
merging, sharing and change tracking. The [GNSS-SDR’s GitHub
repository](https://github.com/gnss-sdr/gnss-sdr){:target="_blank"} hosts all of the data files needed for version control,
being the central “truth” repository resource of GNSS-SDR’s source code. Such reference repository is usually referred to as _upstream_.

A repository is simply a place where the history of the work is stored.
The distributed nature of Git allows users to [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/){:target="_blank"} this repository,
that is, to obtain an exact replica of the original repository at their
own local hard drive. Then, users can build and use the software, modify
the source code, share their work, and contribute back to GNSS-SDR. Git
is a fantastic but complex source code management system - it has a
steep learning curve, but it worth it. A good reference is the freely
available [Git Pro book](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2){:target="_blank"}, but there are plenty of good Git tutorials
out there. If you have never used it, start from the [Git Basics](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics){:target="_blank"} or this [interactive  learning game that takes just 15 minutes](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1){:target="_blank"}.

Branching in Git is one of its many great features. A [branch](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell){:target="_blank"} represents
an independent line of development or, more accurately, a directed
acyclic graph of development. If you have used other version control
systems, it is probably helpful to forget most of what you think about
branches - in fact, it may be more helpful to think of them practically
as contexts since that is how you will most often be using them. When
you checkout different branches, you change contexts that you are
working in, and you can quickly context-switch back and forth between
several different branches. Every time you switch to a new branch, you
will actually see different files in your local folder.

In GNSS-SDR, the source code comes in two flavours: “`master`” and
“`next`” (these are in fact the names of the Git branches). While
“`master`” is the main, most stable branch that contains the latest
release, “`next`” is where all the development is happening, the most
bleeding edge code out there. Once you have cloned the main repository,
you can easily switch between these two branches (or any other created
by you or fetched from other users) by going to your git-cloned
repository and issuing the `git checkout` command with the name of the
desired branch name, like this:

    $ git checkout master   # now you are in the master branch
    $ git checkout next     # now you are in the next branch

If you do not know in which branch you are, pay attention to the first
line of this command’s output:

    $ git status


## How to work with the source code and submit your changes

If you still not have one, please [sign up in GitHub](https://github.com/join){:target="_blank"} and
create your personal account (it's free).

The first thing you need to do in order to submit your changes to the GNSS-SDR repository is to fork from it. This can be done either by following [this link](https://github.com/gnss-sdr/gnss-sdr/fork){:target="_blank"}, by clicking in the following button:

[<i class="fa fa-github fa-lg"></i> Fork GNSS-SDR from GitHub](https://github.com/gnss-sdr/gnss-sdr/fork){: .btn .btn--geniuss .btn--x-large}
{: style="text-align: center;"}

or by browsing to [https://github.com/gnss-sdr/gnss-sdr](https://github.com/gnss-sdr/gnss-sdr){:target="_blank"} and clicking in the Fork button at the upper-right corner of the screen: ![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/fork_button.jpg)

Once you have forked the repository, open a terminal and (if you have not done so yet) [configure Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/){:target="_blank"} with some basic information, such as your identity:

```
$ git config user.name "Your Name"
$ git config user.email "your@email.abc"
```

The email you specify should be the same one found in your [GitHub email settings](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-email-address-to-your-github-account/){:target="_blank"}.

Then, go to your favourite working folder and type:

    $ git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/gnss-sdr

Now, you have a local copy of your fork of the GNSS-SDR repository into a
directory called `gnss-sdr`.

When you fork a project in order to propose changes to the original repository, you can configure Git to pull changes from the original, or _upstream_, repository into the local clone of your fork. If you type `git remote -v` in a terminal and press **Enter**, you will see the current configured remote repository for your fork:

```
$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/gnss-sdr.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/gnss-sdr.git (push)
```

We can add the original, _upstream_ repository like this:

```
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/gnss-sdr/gnss-sdr.git
```

To verify the new upstream repository you have specified for your fork, type `git remote -v` again. You should see the URL for your fork as `origin`, and the URL for the original repository as `upstream`:

```
$ git remote -v
origin    https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/gnss-sdr.git (fetch)
origin    https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/gnss-sdr.git (push)
upstream  https://github.com/gnss-sdr/gnss-sdr.git (fetch)
upstream  https://github.com/gnss-sdr/gnss-sdr.git (push)
```

Now, you can keep your fork synced with the upstream repository with a few Git commands:

  1.   Fetch the branches and their respective commits from the upstream repository. Commits to `next` will be stored in a local branch, `upstream/next`.

       ```
        $ git fetch upstream
       ```

  2.   Check out your fork's local `next` branch:

       ```
       $ git checkout next
       ```

  3.   Merge the changes from `upstream/next` into your local `next` branch. This brings your fork's `next` branch into sync with the upstream repository, without losing your local changes:

       ```
       $ git merge upstream/next
       ```


Now that you are up to date, go to the `next` branch and create a new
branch off from it:

    $ git checkout next
    $ git checkout -b my_feature

Whenever you want to work on something, create a branch for it. Then, do
your changes, stage modified and new files and do commits:

    ... (change files, compile, test) ...
    $ git add file1.cc file1.h ...    # This is called file staging
    $ git commit -m "adding stuff"    # Records staged files to the repository

As you edit files, Git sees them as modified, because you have changed
them since your last commit. You stage these modified files and then
commit all your staged changes, and the cycle repeats. The command git
add puts the files into a “staging area”, an index where you get to
determine what changes get shipped away in the next commit, that is,
what files are going to be recorded to the repository. If you need more
details about this process, check this Git tutorial on how to record
changes in your repository. Next figure summarizes this workflow:


![Git repository]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/git-repository.jpg)
{: style="text-align: center;"}

Once you are done with your changes in your local repository, it's time to push that changes to your Github repository:

```
$ git push origin my_feature
```

Then, go onto the GitHub site, visit your repository, switch to your `my_feature` branch, and click the _Pull Request_ button than will do all the work for you.

Once a pull request is sent, interested parties can review the set of changes, discuss potential modifications, and even push follow-up commits if necessary.



## How to use someone else’s branch {#app:someonelse}

As a collaboration tool, Git can set up what is known as a remote to
connect to other people’s repositories. Those repositories, in the Git
distributed system, do not need to be on a single server, but can be
anywhere. You can have several of them, each of which generally is
either read-only or read/write for you. Collaborating with others
involves managing these remote repositories and pushing and pulling data
to and from them when you need to share work.

Now, someone might be doing something interesting you care about. Say
this is Carles Fernández and you want to track his work:

    $ git remote add cf git://github.com/carlesfernandez/gnss-sdr.git
    $ git fetch cf    # This downloads all the content from Carles' repo.
    $ git branch -r   # Lists remote branches

Then you can see all your available remote branches (including those of
the remote repository you just added) and their name. You can then
checkout a specific remote branch by typing:

    $ git checkout cf/very_cool_feature

When checking out a remote branch, you can look around, make
experimental changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits
you make in this state without impacting any branches by performing
another checkout. If you want to create a new branch to retain commits
you create, you may do so (now or later) by using `-b` with the
`checkout` command again:

```
$  git checkout -b new_branch_name
```

## Setting up tracking branches {#app:someonelse}

When you create a new local branch off from next, it diverges from your
local next at that point in time:

```
$ git checkout next
$ git checkout --track -b my_feature
```

If you want to keep that new branch updated with the new changes of
next, you either need to pull changes through next and then rebase your
branch, or remember where your merge point was.

What we have here is `my_feature` tracking `next`, and not
`origin/next`; in other words, it is a local branch tracking another
local branch. There are times when this is useful, but what if you want
to track the remote one directly instead of having to pull through a
local copy? The solution is to have a tracking branch.

In Git terminology, a tracking branch is a local branch that is
connected to a remote branch. When you `push` and `pull` on that branch,
it automatically pushes and pulls to the remote branch that it is
connected with.

Checking out a local branch from a remote branch automatically creates a
tracking branch. If you are on a tracking branch and type `git push`,
Git automatically knows which server and branch to push to. Also,
running `git pull` while on one of these branches fetches all the remote
references and then automatically merges in the corresponding remote
branch.

When you clone a repository, it automatically creates a master branch
that tracks origin/master. That is why `git push` and `git pull` work
out of the box with no other arguments: if you are on a tracking branch
and type git push, Git automatically knows which server and branch to
push to. However, you can set up other tracking branches if you wish -
ones that do not track branches on `origin` and do not track the
`master` branch.

Say you want to work off the `next` branch. First, you need a copy of
that in your local repository - a tracking branch:

```
$ git fetch --all    # This downloads all available content
$ git branch -r      # Lists remote branches
```

Then, create a local tracking branch called `my_feature` from the remote
branch called `origin/next`:

```
$ git checkout --track -b my_feature origin/next
```

Now you have a branch `my_feature` which is tracking `origin/next`. When
there is an update in the upstream repository, and do a `pull`, you will
see it updating both `next`, and also `my_feature`.

**Important:** Never, ever commit (write) to a local tracking branch.
Always use them as a base to branch off!

## Good coding practices {#app:goodpractices}

-   **Keep you changes referred to the latest commit of `upstream/next`
    branch.** In Git terminology, this is called rebasing a branch. When
    rebasing, you need to specify which branch you want to rebase onto:

        $ git checkout my_feature
        $ git fetch upstream
        $ git rebase upstream/next

    This simply reshuffles your `my_feature` branch patches on top of
    the current `next branch` in the `upstream` remote. Rebasing is a good idea while your feature branch is still in
    development. Check out Scott Chacon’s Git Pro book section about
    [rebasing](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing){:target="_blank"} to find out more details about this concept.

-   **Use an integrated development environment (IDE) with Git
    support.** Most modern C++ IDEs have nice interfaces for using Git.
    An open source, well-known option is [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/){:target="_blank"}, and we love using [EGit](http://www.eclipse.org/egit/){:target="_blank"}, an Eclipse Team provider for
    Git.

-   **Before creating the patch file, please be sure that after your
    modifications everything compiles and runs without problems, and
    clean up your work.** Remove any junk lines or comments you may have
    left while fixing the code, and make sure your follow the
    recommended [coding style]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/coding-style/){:target="_blank"} (indentation, white spaces, naming conventions and
    so on). This will make other developers’ life easier.

-   **Tell us about your branch!** If you have significant changes, you
    can simply email us (again, best way is by mailing list, so other
    users can get to know about you work) and tell us about your code.
    All we need is the link to your remote branch.
